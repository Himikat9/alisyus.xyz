   <h1>How I lost my discord Account</h1>
   <p>Before i continue, Some people may ask "What is MYKI?" MYKI is password manager and 2fa app that means you dont have to write down your passwords or use the same password, MYKI is also a 2fa auth app that means if you put 2fa on your accounts it will require a code from that app, However MYKI is an online password manager and It require your phone number for account creation</p>
   <p>Now what went wrong? I delete my MYKI account</p>
   <p>I was switching to new password managers becuase MYKI is terrible app, I almost added all my accounts on my new password manager Except Discord now after the deletion of MYKI account i realize i just lost my discord 2fa, Password, Email Etc.</p>
   <p>I cant reset the password idk what is the email, I tried discord support but yes they are truely terrible</p>
