   <h1>How I lost my main discord Account</h1>
   <p>Before i continue, Some people may ask "What is MYKI?"</p>
   <p>MYKI is password manager and 2fa app that means you dont have to write down your passwords or use the same password, MYKI is also a 2fa auth app that means if you put 2fa on your accounts it will require a code from that app, However MYKI is an online password manager and It require your phone number for account creation</p>
   &nbsp;
   <p>--> Now what went wrong? I delete my MYKI account</p>
   <p>I was switching to new password managers becuase MYKI is terrible app, I almost added all my accounts on my new password manager Except Discord now after the deletion of MYKI account i realize i just lost my discord 2fa, Password, Email Etc.</p>
   <p>I cant reset the password idk what is the email, I tried discord support but yes they are truely terrible</p>
